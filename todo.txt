- make array a heap
- push all the tasks into a local XML or JSON file
- add a function to see all tasks in X order 
	- X = time priority, due date priority, easiest
- spit out the one task the person should do from a certain question
[I have very little time] [I'm feeling very motivated] [Doing the thing due soon]
- complete a task (remove object from array)

- add a weekly task [advanced]
   - start date - end date
   - only shows one of these weekly tasks at a time
